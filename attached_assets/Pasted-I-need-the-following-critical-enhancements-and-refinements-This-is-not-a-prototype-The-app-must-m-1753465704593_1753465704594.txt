I need the following critical enhancements and refinements.

This is not a prototype. The app must meet FAANG-level standards — enterprise-grade, secure, tested, and truly production-ready.

🚨 MISSION CRITICAL DIRECTIVES
❗ DO NOT delay, skip, or partially implement anything — no missing logic, no unfinished sections.

❗ All features and functions must be fully implemented, type-safe, tested, and connected.

✅ Architecture must be modular, scalable, and runtime-error-proof — no dangling imports, broken state, or dead features.

✅ Ensure security hardening across the code: sanitize inputs, avoid unsafe state mutations, and follow best practices.

💯 Code must be clean, typed, documented, and safely export all hooks, constants, and actions.

🧪 Include unit tests and integration tests for all critical functions (task creation, calendar sync, localization, Dexie state).

⚙️ CORE STACK
React + TypeScript (Vite bundler)

Tailwind CSS (use 8pt spacing grid for consistent layout)

React Router

Zustand or Jotai (for reliable local state)

IndexedDB via Dexie.js (or idb)

Vite PWA plugin

lucide-react or Tabler Icons (modern, lightweight icons only)

fullcalendar, dnd-kit, recharts

i18next or react-intl (no hardcoded text)

🖥️ DESIGN + UX STANDARDS
100% Responsive: works seamlessly on phones, tablets, desktops (Windows, Android, iOS)

Spacing must follow 8pt design grid – no misaligned or oversized elements

Professional UI with clean padding, consistent layout, and intuitive spacing

Light/Dark mode toggle with safe transitions

Accessible by default (semantic markup, a11y roles, focus traps, etc.)

No “offline user” or “offline ready” badges anywhere in UI (remove top bar and sidebar mentions)

No unnecessary icons: remove Search and Notifications icons in Dashboard top bar

📋 REQUIRED MODULE IMPROVEMENTS
✅ DASHBOARD
🔧 Remove Search and Notifications icons from top right

🔁 Ensure live updates — when a task, event, goal, or reminder is created/edited elsewhere, it reflects instantly here

📊 Display all items in real time by correct time, tag, date, group, and status

✅ TASKS
Must support full task creation features:

 Title

 Due date

 Start date

 Priority (P1–P4)

 Grouping

 Tagging

 Location (text or geotag if browser supports)

 Recurrence rules (“every Monday”, “every 3 days”)

 Subtasks and checklist

All fields must be live-bound to the state and update calendar + analytics instantly

🔁 All these features must also apply to: Create Goal, Create Reminder, and Create Event

✅ CALENDAR
The Month view is currently missing — implement fully

Support Day / Week / Month views, with smooth drag-to-reschedule

Ensure all items (tasks, reminders, events) display in correct time slots

Calendar state must sync with all sections in real time

✅ SETTINGS
Remove Notifications and Accessibility sections — not needed

Remove any "offline/local user" text or icons from bottom sidebar

Add localization for additional languages:

Arabic (RTL layout support)

German

Hindi

Portuguese (Brazil)

Chinese (Simplified)

Japanese

Korean

English, Spanish, and French are already implemented — leave them

All strings on every screen must be translatable — no hardcoded text

🌐 LOCALIZATION
Use i18next or react-intl

All strings must be in translation files (not inline)

Support LTR/RTL layout switching (especially for Arabic)

Auto-detect and fallback language support

Locale-specific date/time formatting

🔁 LIVE REACTIVE LOGIC
All components must reactively share state (Zustand/Jotai): no stale views

Creating or updating a task, goal, event, or reminder should:

Update calendar

Reflect in dashboard

Update analytics

Show tags in tag filters immediately

No refresh or re-fetch should be needed

🧪 TESTING & STABILITY
Include unit tests for:

Task creation

Calendar sync logic

Goal completion

State mutations in Zustand or Jotai

Include integration tests for:

Localization switching

Offline persistence with Dexie

Realtime syncing between views

Wrap all async actions with error handling + toast feedback

Add error boundaries for UI crashes

Ensure no circular imports, missing exports, or runtime crashes

🛡️ SECURITY & SAFETY
All input fields should be XSS-safe, sanitized

Never mutate state unsafely — always use set() or safe actions

No global state hacks or localStorage side-effects without fallback handling

PIN lock option must not expose user input

Never leave dangling promise calls or unhandled rejections

📌 FINAL REMINDERS
🔁 All features must be reactive, real, and fully connected

🎯 No mockups or placeholder logic — use real schema, types, and Dexie persistence

📦 All exports (state, components, actions) must be defined and used cleanly

🧠 UX must be tight, accessible, and spaced correctly on all screen sizes

🧼 Remove any UI clutter, placeholder buttons, or debug logs

This app should feel like a blazing-fast local version of Notion + Todoist + Google Calendar — professional, private, fast, and 100% offline-capable.
