You’ve done great progress, but several critical functionalities remain either incomplete or improperly implemented.

Please read this carefully and make no assumptions. You must fully follow the specifications and correct all remaining issues. This is not optional or exploratory — we need a finished, high-quality, real-use productivity platform as originally defined.

❗ MAJOR ISSUES TO FIX
1. ✅ Task / Event / Goal / Reminder creation forms are still basic
They must all include and persist the following fields:

Title

Description (optional)

Date / Start time / End time

Priority (e.g. P1, P2, etc.)

Tags

Group/project

Location (optional string)

Recurrence rules

Linked items (i.e. link a reminder to a task or goal)

Sub-items (subtasks or sub-goals)

You may reuse schema and UI logic across sections (DRY), but all forms must be complete, reactive, validated, and stored in Dexie (IndexedDB) immediately.

2. 🔁 Instant Live Sync with Calendar
When a task, event, goal, or reminder is created or modified, it must automatically show up at the correct date and time in the Calendar view (Day / Week / Month).
No reloads. No manual syncing.
Use reactive local state (Zustand or Jotai) to handle this live connection.

3. 📆 Streak calendar in Analytics is broken
Right now, the streak calendar says "coming soon."
This must be implemented and functional. It should:

Show streaks for completed tasks/goals per day

Calculate consecutive days of activity (e.g., habit tracking)

Update immediately when a task/goal is marked complete

4. 🧱 NO Remote Database — Offline-First Only
You mentioned that I should consider a database.

This is incorrect and must be corrected.
The app is explicitly designed as an offline-first app using local-only data.

You must not require or mention external cloud databases

Use Dexie.js (IndexedDB) to store all user data locally

Data must persist offline, sync instantly, and be 100% usable with no internet

Reaffirm and re-architect wherever needed to comply with this.

✅ WHAT’S ALREADY GOOD — KEEP IT
✅ Complete calendar with day/week/month views
✅ RTL support and full i18n for Arabic, Spanish, French, etc.
✅ Clean professional UI (good progress)
✅ IndexedDB integration
✅ No login / no cloud / no backend
✅ Sidebar & top bar cleaned up
✅ Modular scalable React + TypeScript codebase

📌 NEXT CRITICAL STEPS
✅ Fix and upgrade all Add/Create forms with full field support across:

Tasks

Events

Goals

Reminders

🔁 Ensure they are reactive:

Any creation must sync live to:

Dashboard

Calendar

Analytics

Streaks

📊 Implement streak calendar under Analytics

Show daily streaks (task/goal completion)

Use a heatmap or simple calendar-style streak UI

Fully reactive — reflects changes instantly

🧪 Add robust testing

Test task creation, streak calculations, live sync behavior, and localization switching

Include unit + integration tests using vitest or similar

🔐 Final security & safety pass

Sanitize all user input

Type-safety across all stores

Error boundaries and validation

Offline resilience and fallback

🧠 Reminder
This app is meant to be a fully local-first Notion + Todoist + Google Calendar hybrid, built for serious personal productivity with:

Professional design

Offline-first behavior

Reactive architecture

No missing logic

Secure, scalable, modular components

Do not leave anything incomplete or unlinked. Every feature must be real, connected, and reliable.
