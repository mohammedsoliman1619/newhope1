The current version of the app is functional and the UI is designed, but the spacing, alignment, and sizing are inconsistent across various components and screens. I need you to now go back and refine the visual and structural aspects of the entire UI, using modern design standards and ensuring perfect responsiveness across phones, tablets, and desktops.

üß± Key Instructions (What Must Be Done)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Fix Spacing, Alignment, and Sizing
Follow a modular spacing scale (e.g., 4/8/12/16/24/32px equivalents via Tailwind)

Ensure all components have consistent padding/margin/gap

Make sure buttons, icons, cards, and inputs are not oversized or too cramped

Group related items logically using gap, flex, and grid utilities

2Ô∏è‚É£ Modernize Icons & Visuals
Use clean, modern icon libraries like lucide-react or tabler-icons

Replace outdated icons or illustrations with minimal, sharp icons

All icons must be properly sized, aligned, and padded (e.g., w-5 h-5, me-2, etc.)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Topbar Cleanup
Remove any placeholder text like ‚ÄúOffline‚Äù or demo/debug labels in the top nav

The topbar should only show essential, clean elements like app name/logo, theme toggle, language switcher, etc.

Layout should adapt cleanly to smaller screens (collapse menu, iconize toggles, etc.)

4Ô∏è‚É£ Full Device Responsiveness
The app must look great and function flawlessly on:

üì± Phones (portrait + landscape)

üì± Tablets (iPad, Galaxy Tab, etc.)

üñ•Ô∏è Windows desktops/laptops (regular and ultrawide)

Use Tailwind‚Äôs responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) to adapt:

Layout (flex/grid direction)

Text sizing and spacing

Component visibility or stacking

Ensure no horizontal scrollbars, clipped text, or overlapping UI elements

5Ô∏è‚É£ Layout & Typography Hierarchy
Follow clear visual hierarchy using Tailwind typography utilities:

text-2xl font-semibold for headers

text-base leading-relaxed for body text

text-sm for labels/subtext

Ensure consistent use of font weights, spacing between titles and content, and no abrupt visual breaks

6Ô∏è‚É£ Component Polish
Cards: rounded-2xl, shadow-sm, consistent inner padding (p-4 or p-6)

Buttons: Same height (h-10/h-12), consistent font, spacing between icon and text

Lists: Proper item spacing, hover states, and no overflows

Forms: Consistent label-input spacing, proper focus ring (focus:outline-none focus:ring-2)

‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Requirements
Ensure all sections and logic are fully implemented, nothing half-done or deferred

Use modular, reusable architecture to reduce future bugs

Validate that each component handles runtime gracefully (no console errors, fallback UI, error boundaries)

üîÑ Final Output Expectation
A clean, fully polished, and responsive UI that works across all major screen sizes, uses modern icons, has no placeholder artifacts, and presents a professional, production-ready interface with proper spacing, layout, and interaction.
